			<description>In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how I am using Linode Kubernetes Engine(LKE) and Terraform to setup the infrastructure for Hivenetes (a personal project that I am working on). I chose Linode as the cloud provider as it is extremely easy to setup, cost effective and many more. I dont think I will use any other cloud provider other than Linode at least for my personal projects. Now that I have established my love for Linode, let&amp;rsquo;s get started shall we?</description>

			<description>Here is a bit of a back story for the readers to understand the context better. We have our software(microservices) running on linux servers that will deployed across the globe. We also have our cloud platform through which we gain insights on our software[ more on that in a later blog] but that lacks the node and container metrics we need to monitor our servers. Due to the nature of the business, we have limted/restricted access to the client&amp;rsquo;s network.</description>

I intend to use this space as a digital journal for all things cloud-native. The posts will be centered around the following topics but certainly not limited to
  Cloud native tools and software</description>
