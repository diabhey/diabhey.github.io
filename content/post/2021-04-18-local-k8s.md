Nowadays, there are many off-the-shelf solutions to get k8s up and running. Here are some of the Lightweight Kubernetes out there, 
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
* [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/)
* [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
* [LKE (not free)](https://www.linode.com/)

These k8s distribution have ample documentation and examples online that will easily help you set it up. 

# Let's do it the hard way
In this blog post, I will guide the readers through a series of steps that I did to set up a multi-node [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster at home. 

### Pre-requisites
- [System Requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#before-you-begin)
- [Hardware Requirements](https://docs.kublr.com/installation/hardware-recommendation/#kublr-kubernetes-cluster-requirements)

Cluster node requirements is dependent on what you are going to run on k8s. I will assume you have met the minimum requirements to get started.

**My Setup**
- Control Plane: [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc/kits.html)
- Worker Nodes: Two old laptops
- Both Control Plane and Woker Nodes are running [Ubuntu 20.04-LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/)
