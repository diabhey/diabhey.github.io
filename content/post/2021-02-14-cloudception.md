On Valentines day, I decided to go public about my love affair with the cloud.  The more time I spend in the open source world, the stronger I feel to share my thoughts with all the CloudSurfers out there.

I intend to use this space as a digital journal for all things cloud-native. The posts will be centered around the following topics but certainly not limited to

* Cloud native tools and software

* Hobby projects

* Solutions to a technical problem

* Cloud Native Conferences, Courses, Meetups

Let the journey begin...
